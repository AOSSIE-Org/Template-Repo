      - [ ] Integrate the StabilityNexus TokenList
      - [ ] Implement UI dropdown/selector for supported tokens
      - [ ] Keep the option for manual contract address input
      - [ ] Validate manually entered contract addresses
      - [ ] Add token logo/icon display in the selector
      - [ ] Implement token search/filter functionality
      - [ ] Add proper error handling for invalid addresses
      - [ ] Test with various tokens from the list
      - [ ] Update documentation with new token selection feature
